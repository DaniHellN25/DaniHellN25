#### Hey World, Dani here.

<div align='left'>
         
🎮 I'm really passionate about several things but... two of those things are: Programming and videogames. I'm a graduated Full Stack Developer, but I'm more curious about backend. For me almost everything is a puzzle to solve and that's something that encourage me to solve them. Oh, and I work with agile methodologies too.
         
🏆 I've met some amazing people so far, and I've had the privilage to code with some of them which was a really fulfilling experience that helped me with grown as a person and as a developer.
</br> I invite you to see my projects! Scrolling down you will find my pinned repositories.
         
🎓 Full Stack Developer & Bachelor's degree in gastronomy.
         
🌱 I’m currently learning about AI and Machine Learning, and also I'm continously improving my current skills working in personal projects.

🕹 My hobbies are playing videogames, coding, reading(about different topics), and watching series and movies.
